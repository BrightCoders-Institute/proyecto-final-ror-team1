/shipments_tracker/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/shipments_tracker/log/*
/shipments_tracker/tmp/*
!/shipments_tracker/log/.keep
!/shipments_tracker/tmp/.keep

/tmp/rubycritic/rubycritic-app/

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/shipments_tracker/tmp/pids/*
!/shipments_tracker/tmp/pids/
!/shipments_tracker/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
/shipments_tracker/storage/*
!/shipments_tracker/storage/.keep
/shipments_tracker/tmp/storage/*
!/shipments_tracker/tmp/storage/
!/shipments_tracker/tmp/storage/.keep
